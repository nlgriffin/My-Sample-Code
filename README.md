# My-Sample-code
This repository is meant for public sharing of my code and data analysis skills. Included are snippets from a multitude of projects I have worked on both for academic and personal interest reasons. In many cases, complete pipelines of collection and storage or complete datasets are not included.  All code is written in Python.
