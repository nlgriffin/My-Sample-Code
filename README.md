# My-Sample-code
This repository is meant for public sharing of my code and data skills. Included are snippets from a multitude of projects I have worked on both for academic and personal interest reasons. In many cases, complete pipelines of collection and storage or complete datasets are not included.  All code is written in Python.  
All project reports were done through graduate school and were group projects. My capstone project, which was completed in my 3rd semester, is the most complex problem I have worked on. It was for a large company with sensitive information involved, so I am unable to share. I am happy to discuss that project and what I learned without sharing senstive portions.
