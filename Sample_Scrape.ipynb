    "### Step 1: Extract urls from IMBD search\n",
    "[IMDB Search](https://www.imdb.com/search/title/)\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is motivated by the groups interest in movies and being able to pull some specific datasets for analysis on demand. While IMDB does have some datasets puiblicly available, they are small (at most 8 columns), and would require significant merging to obtain what we are going for. Further, there is no box office information in these datasets, and earnings is the most significant variable that we would like to analyze. Beyond insterest in this industry, this application is also motivated by the fact that web scraping is a valuable tool for every data scientist to have at their disposal. Any time there is a lack of data in a problem you are facing, there is potentially valuable information available somewhere on the internet, and being able to extract it, clean it, and test it's validity allows for solving problems that otherwise may seem unsolvable. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in this application is to take an input search (link above) and return a list of urls: one for each movie that satisfies those parameters. To implement this function, we will need the help of a few libraries: BeautifulSoup, urllib, and webbrowser (for debugging). The first thing to do is just take a look at what the search returns in the actual webpage. The things that jump out are: the total number of movies that match the search listed at the top as well as there being 50 movies per page. Therefore, we know two important variables right off the bat: how many urls we expect to return and how many webpages we will have to iterate over to get them all. \n",
    "\n",
    "The function, therefore, will begin by creating a BeautifulSoup object (i.e. a parsed HTML file) of the search url by opening the search url with urllib. Right away, we extract the total number of films returned from this query using the find_all method in BeautifulSoup, replacing the comma with nothing, and converting the resulting string to an integer. We then print the number for the users reference. From here, we need to understand how to move through each page of the query. By looking at page two, we see that it is, fortunately, pretty simple. By just appending \"&start=n\" where n is some number, to the search url, we can look at a page with 50 entries, starting at the nth entry. Getting a list of these numbers is a simple list comprehension. \n",
    "\n",
    "From there, we iterate each of these urls, creating a new BeautifulSoup object each time, and grabbing all links from the page using the get and findall methods. From the list of links, we look for a specific string 'title/tt' that corresponds to movie webpages, add it to the list of final urls, checking to make sure it is not already there. Once it iterates through each page and adds all urls, a test is run to ensure that the number of movies in the search matches the length of the final url list. \n",
    "\n",
    "There was an issue initially with the length of the list exceeding the number of movies in the search, so some debugging was required.  In some cases, there was only one extra link, while in others there was more than 100. The webbrowser library was used to open every 50 links to see which page was adding extra information. In hindsight, a more efficient option may be to just print how many items were added to the list in each loop and look for values over 50. Regardless, the issue was that some movies had a link to sequels/prequels included with them. This did not show up on the webpage, but was included in the html file. Further, each valid url was listed 3 seperate times, one with an extra directory in the url. Since these were the only title links with a length of 4 when split on '/', that is ultimately how we filter out for valid urls. It also avoids checking for duplicate values in the list twice for a better optimized runtime."
